SCRATCHPAD:

Loops
fnc rungame
    if towers on map
        checkCollide()
        loop through towers
            loop through enemies
            get distance from each tower to each enemy
            if enemy x is in range
                get closest enemy and shoot




Towers
all towers are firing bullets at the one enemy
this enemy is the one that is closest to the first tower that is
in range

{ bullets shoot x number of bullets, refresh bullets based on inventory bullet #}
towershootcount is a universal count in 'game_state.js:197'
bullets shot on 'main.js:181'
get towers own counter and update count on fire, if count is higher than max bullets, reset to zero
"thistowerbullets" is attached to each tower (pushed) as an array of new bullets
