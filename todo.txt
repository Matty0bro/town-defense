    > fix the bullet collision
        > issue: everything EXCEPT what is in the tower range is currently dying
            - drawing the x and y next to each enemy
            - slowing down bullets and altering to 3 bullets with positions printing

// SATURDAY
> fix dropping of towers onto path
    > towers should not be droppable on path
    > red color for hover where tile is not allowed
    > fix multiple towers becoming selected when mouse hovers

+ make each tower different
    1) tower one - as is
    2) tower 2 - more bullets
    3) tower 3 - more bullets and jitter
    + add more jitter + bullets for different tower types
    + (optional) make the enemy shoot direction compensate based
      on distance (get distance on fire and add to x/y)
+ when lives = 0, gamestate = end screen
+ add cash for enemy kills (change cost to $10, $20, $30)
+ end game on 0 lives, refresh page when spacebar is pressed
+ CONSOLIDATE LOOPS TO FIX LOOP ISSUES (affects bullet firing and collisions)

// SUNDAY
+ add music and artwork (sfx if there is time)
    + (ESSENTIAL) put cash label on towers
    + change opening image (creative commons spooky image)
    + spooky sound track
    + play death sound when enemy dies

+ (optional) add enemy health depletion

Loops
fnc rungame
    if towers on map
        checkCollide()
        loop through towers
            loop through enemies
            get distance from each tower to each enemy
            if enemy x is in range
                get closest enemy and shoot




Towers
all towers are firing bullets at the one enemy
this enemy is the one that is closest to the first tower that is
in range

{ bullets shoot x number of bullets, refresh bullets based on inventory bullet #}
towershootcount is a universal count in 'game_state.js:197'
bullets shot on 'main.js:181'
get towers own counter and update count on fire, if count is higher than max bullets, reset to zero
"thistowerbullets" is attached to each tower (pushed) as an array of new bullets
